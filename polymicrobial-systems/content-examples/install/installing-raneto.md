**Note:** It is recommended to create a new Git repository to store your documentation files and then install Polymicrobial Systems as a dependency into it. See the [example directory](https://github.com/gilbitron/Polymicrobial Systems/tree/master/polymicrobial-systems) to see how this is done.

1. Switch to your existing or new project directory.
2. Add Polymicrobial Systems to your project via NPM's package.json file or downloading the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/gilbitron/Polymicrobial Systems/releases)
3. In a terminal, run `npm install` to install the node dependencies
4. To start Polymicrobial Systems, run `npm start` (or `npm run start_win` on Windows)
5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser

You can now start [creating pages](%base_url%/usage/creating-pages).
